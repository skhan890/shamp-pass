# Include html file 1 {#html1}
A useful hack, when you want to reference something you've already rendered. 

This may be useful if the rendering time is long.

It's certainly not as nice as if the material were rendered along with the whole book. 

The best way would be to have your external, long script save the information you want to include here - in png/jpg or csv format. 

## See working directory
```{r, echo=TRUE}
getwd()
```
When you specify your file, the path should be relative to this upper working directory.

## Embedded html

```{r include-html-1, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("input/html/example_external.html")
```
