To add custom chapters, simply create new .Rmd files in this folder and add their names in the desired point in the list of .Rmd files in _bookdown.yml. The chapters included are: Chapter Content Setup Reads in the “Parameters.R” file that establishes the baseline variables by which the descriptive statistics will be stratified. Load packages and shows sessionInfo. Introduction Information on the project purpose, background information on datasets that were used, and other datasets that were considered. Data Notes on (and/or links to other documents containing notes on) how the raw data were prepared for this analysis. Ego Characteristics Demographic and other characteristics of the egos. Degree Momentary degree (e.g., extant/active ties only) and concurrency of egos. Mixing Mixing matrices of egos and alters on nodal attributes One-Times Rates of one-time relationships Edge Age Age of active/extant ties Decisions Analytical decisions made after considering the descriptives, including model specification choices. ERGMs ERGM fits and diagnostics Parameters List of parameter values for modeling.

Martina noted that data cannot be combined in ergm.ego until the formats are similar for the stats for ERGM. 2.2 Modelling immigrant spouses who live in home country See Issue #151. 2.3 Life expectancy for HIV + Issue #60 links to a paper on “Population-Based Estimates of Life Expectancy After HIV Diagnosis: United States 2008-2011”. 2.4 Nodematched Cohabs too low for B/BI/H/HI See Issues #149 and the comment Martina made in the Diagnostics Sept 2018 model run in Issue #146. See the Model Cohab section to see how the terms plateau low - they also were low in the Spring 2019 models. 2.5 Age related within and cross-net concurrency Focusing on an agecat3 x deg.pers interaction would be worth exploring in the future (Issue #102). 2.6 Removing alters with missing data Currently - 5% of nodes are missing information on age (See Issue #120). This raised an issue of deleting alters to get the ergms to run. Jeanette wants to explore if there are problems with missing data and dropping alters on the initial network. Full discussion of this, and consequences for WHAMP are explored in Issue #62. 2.7 Add 10 year death rate data See Issue #61. "],

This may be useful if the rendering time is long. It’s certainly not as nice as if the material were rendered along with the whole book. The best way would be to have your external, long script save the information you want to include here - in png/jpg or csv format. 3.1 See working directory getwd() ## [1] &quot;C:/Users/SKhan/OneDrive - UW/Documents/GitHub/shamp-pass&quot; When you specify your file, the path should be relative to this upper working directory. 3.2 Embedded html ` "],

Advances in HIV treatment and prevention have changed the intervention policy landscape, and public health departments in the US are now tasked with determining which combination of treatment and prevention strategies will have the greatest impact. Epidemic modeling is a valuable resource for this type of comprehensive HIV prevention planning. However, these models are often parameterized with a combination of data from multiple populations. As a result they are not rooted in, or representative of, a local epidemic, even though treatment and prevention strategies are designed mostly at state and local levels in the U.S. (Source: Abstract from SHAMP/Dropbox/Awarded/RevisedApplication.pdf)) 4.2 Terminology Term Definition sb (sex-black race) ds (degree-sex) dsb (degree-sex-black race) cohab cohabitating pers persistent relationship ot onetime H Hispanic HI Hispanic Immigrant BI Non-Hispanic Black immigrant BI Non-Hispanic Black W Non-Hispanic Other W Non-Hispanic White xnet cross-network conc Concurrency components disconnected parts of a social network S/C Spouse or cohab dissolution relationship dissolving offset ERGM term: no relationships of any type netdx EpiModel term to make ERGM diagnostics static netdx no dissolution included dynamic netdx allow relationship dissolution 4.3 Previous presentations Nov 9, 2016 - Roxanne Kerani, African Immigrants Living with HIV in King County, WA July 7, 2018 - Deven Hamilton, Partnerships durations: Do they meet our expectations?

See Issue #46. Additional information about creating pseudopop estimates from PHSKC are detailed in Issue #37. See more information from Susan Buskin at Issue #36. Table shells, and more information about the PHSKC, are in Issue #23. For MMP data: we did not use it, but see ]Issue #19](https://github.com/statnet/SHAMP/issues/19) on more information about it. 4.5 National Population based surveys 4.5.1 NSFG - National Survey of Family Growth - CDC. used in final models Longitudinal study done in cycles by the CDC to measure trends related to families, fertiliy and health (Source: CDC).** Information to note for future SHAMP-related projects: The 2006-2010 datasets had data on contacts for sexual data. This needed a request through CSDE to obtain. 2015-2017 did not include those variables.

(https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/statistics/systems/nhbs/index.html) Age group available: 18-50+ Coital acts: Available Condom use: Available According to Issue #49: “From NHBS, they report ITI for MSM in 2013 is 7.7 mos and for high-risk heterosexuals is 19.9 mos.” 4.5.4 Add Health - National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health - did not use in final models The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) is a longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of adolescents in grades 7-12 in the United States during the 1994-95 school year. The Add Health cohort has been followed into young adulthood with four in-home interviews, the most recent in 2008, when the sample was aged 24-3.
